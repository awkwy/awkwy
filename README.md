# Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

I am Lionel Payet, a Master's student in "IngÃ©nierie Statistique et Ã‰conomique de la Finance, de l'Assurance et du Risque" at the University of Paris Nanterre. 
Passionate about data science and contextualization, I am currently looking for an apprenticeship as an actuary or data scientist for the 2024/2025 academic year. 
My academic background and projects have equipped me with expertise in tools like Python, R, and SQL, which I could use for predictive modeling, risk assessment, and pricing in the insurance industry.

On this GitHub, you will find my personal and academic projects, including work on time series analysis and financial data, as well as web applications I have developed for teaching and data analysis.

I am particularly motivated by opportunities in innovative companies, where I can apply my skills in data science, actuarial science, and risk management to impactful and concrete projects. Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if youâ€™d like to connect!
